                    The tool of modernity: Digital Marketing
                </p>
                <p class="textsmall">Digital Marketing can be seen as a new philosophy and business practice emerging
                    with improvements in technology. Goods, services, and even ideas and information can be marketed
                    using the internet today. Traditional marketing still exists, but it may slowly begin to dissolve
                    for a majority of the market in the coming decades. Digital marketing makes shopping easier for the
                    consumer.

        <p class="sectionSubTag"> <span>Understanding the market...</span><br>One way marketers can reach out to
            consumers and understand their thought process is through what is called an empathy map. An empathy map is a
            four-step process. The first step is through asking questions that the consumer would be thinking in their
            demographic. The second step is to describe the feelings that the consumer may be having. The third step is
            to think about what the consumer would say in their situation. The final step is to imagine what the
            consumer will try to do based on the other three steps. This map is so marketing teams can put themselves in
            their target demographics shoes. Web Analytics are also a very important way to understand consumers. They
            show the habits that people have online for each website. One particular form of these analytics is
            predictive analytics which helps marketers figure out what route consumers are on. This uses the information
            gathered from other analytics and then creates different predictions of what people will do so that
            companies can strategize on what to do next, according to the people's trends.</br>

            Consumer behavior: the habits or attitudes of a consumer that influences the buying process of a product or
            service. Consumer behavior impacts virtually every stage of the buying process specifically in relation to
            digital environments and devices.
            Predictive analytics: a form of data mining that involves using existing data to predict potential future
            trends or behaviors. Can assist companies in predicting future behavior of customers.employing research of
            consumer behavior regarding habits like brand awareness and buying behavior to profile prospective
            customers.[100] Establishing a buyer persona helps a company better understand their audience and their
            specific wants/needs.

            <span>Sharing economy</span><br>The "sharing economy" refers to an economic pattern that aims to obtain a
            resource that is not fully used. Nowadays, the sharing economy has had an unimagined effect on many
            traditional elements including labor, industry, and distribution system. This effect is not negligible that
            some industries are obviously under threat.The sharing economy is influencing the traditional marketing
            channels by changing the nature of some specific concept including ownership, assets, and recruitment.</br>

            Digital marketing channels and traditional marketing channels are similar in function that the value of the
            product or service is passed from the original producer to the end user by a kind of supply chain. Digital
            Marketing channels, however, consist of internet systems that create, promote, and deliver products or
            services from producer to consumer through digital networks. Increasing changes to marketing channels has
            been a significant contributor to the expansion and growth of the sharing economy. Such changes to marketing
            channels has prompted unprecedented and historic growth. In addition to this typical approach, the built-in
            control, efficiency and low cost of digital marketing channels is an essential features in the application
            of sharing economy.
